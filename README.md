# xjmac-codec
Just a bit change from JMAC library version 1.7.4

This project was copied from jmac project, the original project site was: <http://jmac.sourceforge.net/>

I need the jmac work together with java sound api, but the original project seems not be updated for a long time, so I copied this project.

I copied this project just for my own purposes, but I had no knowledge about APE codec nor java sound api, so this project is most likely not updated, please don't depends on this project, thanks!
